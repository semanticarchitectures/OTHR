# Arctic OTHR Program Schedule Model
# UNCLASSIFIED // PUBLIC RELEASE
# Version 1.0 Framework - January 21, 2026

# - Based on ROTHR timeline (~4 years but leveraged existing OTH-B)
# - Assumes mature technology (JORN Phase 6 baseline)
# - Arctic construction constraints (6-month construction season)
# - Environmental review timelines (2-3 years typical)

# SCHEDULE VISUALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:
# Import this CSV into project management software (MS Project Primavera GanttProject) or
# Use Python/Excel to create Gantt chart visualization
#
# CRITICAL PATH ITEMS (marked with *):
# These tasks directly impact the final completion date
# Any delay in critical path items delays the entire program
# Focus management attention on critical path risk mitigation
#
# PARALLEL VS SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION:
# Baseline schedule: Sites built sequentially (lessons learned between sites)
# Accelerated schedule: Sites built in parallel (higher risk but faster)
#
# KEY DECISION POINTS:
# Month 10: Milestone A - Approve concept development
# Month 26: Milestone B - Approve detailed design start
# Month 51: Milestone C - Approve production/construction start
# Month 82: IOC - First site operational
# Month 121: FOC - Full system certified
