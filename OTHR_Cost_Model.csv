COMPARISON TO HISTORICAL PROGRAMS,,,,,,,
,JORN Phase 6 (3-site upgrade),$800M USD,,,Our estimate: $1735M,,"Higher due to new construction vs upgrade Arctic location"
,ROTHR per site (1990s),$100-300M,,,Our estimate: $280M/site,,"Inflation-adjusted comparable"
,Canada JORN purchase (1 system),$4000M USD,,,Our estimate: $1735M,,"Export premium technology transfer infrastructure development"
,,,,,,,
COST SENSITIVITIES,,,,,,,
,If 3 sites parallel (Accelerated):,Increase,~$150M,,,Peak annual budget spike + logistics overlap,
,If Arctic multiplier 1.5x instead of 2.5x:,Reduction,~$200M,,,Better site selection or logistics,
,If Arctic multiplier 4.0x (Extreme Remote):,Increase,~$300M,,,Significant infrastructure build-out,
,,,,,,,
AI FACILITATOR TEAM NOTE,,,,,,,
,AI-assisted cost estimation:,Time saved: 1-2 weeks,,,Manual WBS development and historical data compilation,
,Update instructions:,1. Modify Qty and Unit Cost columns,,,2. Formulas will auto-recalculate,
,For govt version:,Replace with actual vendor quotes,,,Add classified technology costs,

# FORMULAS EXPLANATION (for spreadsheet implementation):
# Subtotal = Qty × Unit Cost
# TOTAL ACQUISITION = SUM(all subtotals) - Reserves calculated separately
# TOTAL O&S = Annual O&S × 20 years
# TOTAL LIFECYCLE = Acquisition + (Annual O&S × 20)
#
# NOTES ON ARCTIC MULTIPLIER:
# - Site selection can reduce multiplier (choose accessible locations)
# - Seasonal construction limits increase costs
# - Permafrost engineering is unavoidable at high latitudes
# - Logistics costs scale with remoteness (helicopter vs truck access)
#
# COST RISK FACTORS:
# - Exchange rates if using foreign technology (JORN)
# - Commodity prices (copper for antenna arrays fuel for remote ops)
# - Labor availability in Arctic regions
# - Environmental compliance delays
# - Indigenous land use agreements
