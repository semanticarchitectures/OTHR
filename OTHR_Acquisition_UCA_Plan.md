# OTHR Acquisition Strategy: Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA)
## Subject: Long-Lead Transmitter Component Procurement

**UNCLASSIFIED // PUBLIC RELEASE**

### 1. Purpose
This document outlines the process and schedule for utilizing an Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) to accelerate the procurement of long-lead transmitter components for the Arctic OTHR system. This strategy targets the critical path by authorizing work before final contract price definitization.

### 2. Targeted Components (Long-Lead)
- **High-Power Amplifiers (HPAs)**: MW-class transmitters.
- **Waveform Generators**: High-precision signal production.
- **Power Coupling Units**: Specialized HF distribution hardware.
- **Custom RF Enclosures**: Arctic-hardened transmit shelters.

### 3. UCA Process Workflow

| Step | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | **J&A Approval** | Draft and approve Justification and Approval (J&A) for "Other Than Full and Open Competition" if specifically naming vendors, or "Urgency" for the schedule acceleration. |
| **2** | **RFP Issuance** | Issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to the Prime Contractor(s) specifically for the long-lead transmitter package. |
| **3** | **Qualifying Proposal** | Contractor submits a proposal that is sufficiently detailed for the government to begin technical evaluation. |
| **4** | **NTE Determination** | Establish a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) price ceiling for the UCA. |
| **5** | **UCA Award** | Issue the Letter Contract (UCA). This obligates funds (typically 50% of NTE) and authorizes the contractor to place orders. |
| **6** | **Definitization Plan** | Establish the definitization schedule, aiming for final agreement within 180 days. |

### 4. Reasonable Schedule (Baseline: 10 Weeks to Start)

| Phase | Milestone | Duration | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Initiation** | Requirements & J&A Drafting | 2 Weeks | Weeks 1-2 |
| **Solicitation** | Issue RFP to Prime(s) | 1 Week | Week 3 |
| **Response** | Contractor Proposal Development | 3 Weeks | Weeks 4-6 |
| **Evaluation** | Technical Review & NTE Negotiation | 3 Weeks | Weeks 7-9 |
| **Award** | **UCA Issuance (Letter Contract)** | 1 Week | **Week 10** |
| **Execution** | Long-Lead Orders Placed | 1 Week | Week 11 |
| **Post-Award** | Target Definitization Date | 24 Weeks | Month 6-7 |

### 5. Regulatory Constraints (DFARS 217.74)
- **Binding Ceiling**: The UCA must include a Not-To-Exceed (NTE) price.
- **Obligation Limit**: Max 50% of NTE initially; 75% upon receipt of a qualifying proposal.
- **Definitization Deadline**: 180 days after receipt of qualifying proposal or 40% of completion, whichever is earlier.
