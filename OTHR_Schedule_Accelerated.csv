# Arctic OTHR Program Schedule Model - ACCELERATED
# UNCLASSIFIED // PUBLIC RELEASE
# Version 1.0 Framework - January 21, 2026
#
# ACCELERATED STRATEGY:
# - Concurrent site construction (Sites 1, 2, and 3 start in parallel)
# - Fast-tracked environmental reviews (12 months vs 24 months)
# - Overlapped integration and testing
# - RISK: No lessons learned period between site deployments
# - RISK: Higher peak annual budget requirements
#
# CRITICAL PATH ITEMS MARKED WITH (*)
